# tremont

This is a web page of the Parisian Restaurant Tremont, designed and developed by me.

Code is written entirely by me and I focused on using no framwworks and writing code from scratch with a few exceptions.
Frameworks that I used were jQuery for cleaner JavaScript code and Animate on Scroll which made animating elements easier.

This project makes use of most modern CSS tools such as Flexbox, clamp() function, Flexbox gap and such.
