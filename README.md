# Tremont Restaurant

#ABOUT

This is a web page of the Parisian Restaurant Tremont, designed and developed by me.

Code is written entirely by me and I focused on using no frameworks and writing code from scratch with a few exceptions.
Frameworks that I used were jQuery for cleaner JavaScript code and Animate on Scroll which made animating elements easier.

This project makes use of most modern CSS tools such as Flexbox, clamp() function, Flexbox Gap property and such.

I put great emphasis on accessibility and aestethics when I designed this website. Making the website dark-mode only was one of them.
White, or light grey text on dark background is much easier to read and puts less strain on eyes which helps people with visual disabilities navigate this site.
Adding ARIA titles to each element was also one of the accessability features, the whole web site is navigable by keyboard and each link, title or body
of text has a rich description for those using screen readers.
